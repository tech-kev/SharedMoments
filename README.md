## 💪 Motivation

At first, I was looking for a website where my girlfriend and I could capture our moments together. However, I couldn't find anything that met our needs, so I took matters into my own hands. With the help of ChatGPT, I started to develop my own website.

Originally, I had no intention of publishing it. But as the website got more and more features and exceeded my expectations, I decided to rebuild the website and make it accessible to everyone. That's how SharedMoments was born.
